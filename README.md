Grunge music is a subgenre of alternative rock that originated in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in the mid-1980s.
It is known for its heavy, distorted guitar sound and bleak, introspective lyrics.
Grunge bands often drew inspiration from punk rock and heavy metal, and many of them embraced a DIY ethic and an anti-establishment stance.
Some of the most famous grunge bands include Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. 
These bands and others like them helped to define the sound and style of grunge music, 
and their popularity in the 1990s helped to bring alternative rock into the mainstream.
Grunge music is often associated with the grunge fashion trend, which included flannel shirts, ripped jeans, and Converse sneakers. 
It is also associated with the grunge subculture, which embraced a rebellious, countercultural attitude and was often associated with drug use and depression.
Despite its association with a specific time and place, the influence of grunge music can still be heard in contemporary rock music. 
Many current rock bands have cited grunge bands as an influence, and the genre continues to have a dedicated fanbase.
